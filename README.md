###THIS IS REPO FOR HACKSPRINT EVENT PROJECT

##CoLab Canvas: Real-time Visual Collaboration Space

####Project Overview
CoLab Canvas is a dynamic digital workspace where teams can visualize their ideas together in real-time, breaking down the barriers of remote collaboration. Think of it as a shared creative playground where your team's thoughts come to life through interactive mind maps, sticky notes, and freeform drawings – all happening live as you work together.

####Vision Statement
We believe that the best ideas come from organic, natural collaboration – the kind that happens when people gather around a whiteboard or spread sticky notes across a table. CoLab Canvas brings that same energy and spontaneity to remote teams, making distance irrelevant when it comes to creative teamwork.
